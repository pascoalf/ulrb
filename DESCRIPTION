Description: The ulrb package solves the problem of the definition of rarity by replacing 
    human decision with an unsupervised machine learning algorithm (partitionin around medoids, 
    or k-medoids). This algorithm works for any type of microbiome data, provided
    there is an abundance score for each phylogenetic unit. For validation of this 
    method to several kinds of molecular data and environments, please see 
    Pascoal et al, 2023 (in preparation). Preliminary data suggest this method also 
    works well for non-microbiome data, if there is a species abundance table.
