# Explore alternative classifications

So far, we have been considering that the microbial communities are divided into "rare", "undetermined" and "abundant". This division implies that the kmedoids algorithm is considering **k=3**, *i.e.* there are three clusters. However, there are at least two situations where you might want to change the number of clusters:

1. The clusters obtained are non-sense;
2. The biological/ecological questions requires another division.
