# Ecological analysis of microbial rare biosphere defined by ulrb

In this tutorial we will show how the output from `define_rb()` can be readily used for some common ecological analysis. In this case, we will just look at alpha diversity. 

To do so, we have several steps:

a) Clean OTU table (we just want prokaryotes);
b) Rarefy samples (we show this option, because it is very common);
c) Classify OTUs into rare, undetermined or abundant;
d) Merge OTU table with metadata information;
e) Calculate and plot alpha diversity metrics against environmental variables.
